              Betty Johnson - A teacher in the Uk for 20years, during this
              period has served in different positions as Teaching and learning
              consultant for one of the biggest MAT in London, Vice Principal
              and Headteacher of an inner London Primary School. During this
              period, Betty has been dedicated to providing a safe environment
              where all children regardless of the background or ability thrive
              academically and socially. Safeguarding of children is a top
              priority and all KSCIE updates are fully obliged and enforced in
              the settings she has lead. As a educational practitioner who has a
              deeper understanding of the curriculum both in Ghana and in UK,
              she understands the relevance of enriching, broadening childrenâ€™s
              understanding and knowledge outside of the curriculum building
              their cultural capital. Growing up in Ghana where sometimes
              childrenâ€™s confidence could be overshadowed by cultural humility,
              it is my passion to give children the confidence the yneed to be
              bold, speak up and share their knowledge
